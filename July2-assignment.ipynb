    "''' Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.\n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability and enhance the organization of code. \n",
    "It allows developers to define common attributes and behaviors in a base class, which can then be inherited by multiple derived classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance provides several advantages in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reuse: Inherited attributes and methods can be reused by multiple derived classes, reducing redundancy and promoting efficient code development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Inheritance allows you to modularize your code by organizing classes into a hierarchy, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the functionality of your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, which means that objects of different derived classes can be treated as objects of the base class.\n",
    " This promotes flexibility and allows for writing more generic code that can work with different types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding: Derived classes can override the behavior of inherited methods to provide their own implementation, allowing for customization and specialization.'''\n"
